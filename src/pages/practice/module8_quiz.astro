            question: "What is mechanical advantage in machines? (Page 298)",
            options: [
                "The ratio of output force to input force",
                "The ratio of input distance to output distance",

            ],

        },
        {
            question: "What is the main difference between actual mechanical advantage (AMA) and ideal mechanical advantage (IMA)? (Page 298)",
            options: [
                "AMA considers friction while IMA ignores it",
                "AMA uses force while IMA uses distance",
                "AMA is always greater than IMA",
                "AMA is theoretical while IMA is practical"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "The ideal mechanical advantage (IMA) is easier to measure than actual mechanical advantage because it depends on the input and output distances rather than the input and output forces, and represents how much the machine could change the input force if there were no friction."

            question: "What happens to the input force in a machine with mechanical advantage greater than 1? (Page 300)",

                "It decreases",
                "It increases",

                "It gets magnified"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Machines with a mechanical advantage greater than 1 (IMA > 1) means that the machine magnifies (or increases) the input force, reducing the effort you put into the machine."

            options: [
                "150 watts",

            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Using P = W/t, first convert 2 minutes to 120 seconds. Then P = 300J/120s = 2.5 watts. Remember that power in watts equals joules per second."

            options: [
                "Because energy is always created",
                "Because friction exists in all machines",
                "Because work input equals work output",
                "Because mechanical advantage is always greater than 1"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Because there is always some friction, all machines will have an efficiency less than 100%. Some of the work input is always used to overcome friction."
