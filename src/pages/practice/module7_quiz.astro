            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Aristotle incorrectly believed that a continual unbalanced force is required to keep an object moving at a constant speed."
        },
        {

        },
        {
            question: "What was Galileo's major contribution to understanding motion? (Page 238)",
            options: [
                "He invented the stopwatch",
                "He discovered gravity",
                "He proposed that objects would continue moving unless stopped by a force",
                "He proved that heavier objects fall faster"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Galileo argued that an object would continue moving at a constant speed forever unless it was stopped by a force, contrary to Aristotle's belief."
        },
        {
            question: "According to Newton's First Law, what happens to an object in motion when no forces act on it? (Page 240)",
            options: [
                "It gradually slows down",
                "It continues moving in a straight line at constant speed",
                "It accelerates",
                "It stops immediately"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Newton's first law states that an object in motion will stay in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force."
        },
        {
            question: "In the coin and card experiment, why does the coin fall straight down when the card is flicked quickly? (Page 243)",
            options: [
                "Because gravity pulls harder on the coin",
                "Because the coin has more mass than the card",
                "Because no force was applied to the coin, only to the card",
                "Because the coin moves faster than the card"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "When you flick the card, you apply a force to the card but not to the coin. Since no force acts on the coin, it remains motionless until gravity pulls it down."
        },
        {
            question: "Why does a raw egg continue spinning after being briefly stopped while a hard-boiled egg stops? (Page 243)",
            options: [
                "The raw egg is heavier",
                "The hard-boiled egg has more friction",
                "The liquid inside the raw egg maintains its inertia and continues moving",
                "The raw egg has less mass"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Since the raw egg is filled with liquid, both the liquid inside and the shell outside were in motion. When briefly stopped, it wasn't long enough to overcome the inertia of the liquid inside."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens when you're riding in a car and the driver suddenly applies the brakes? (Page 240)",

                "You immediately stop with the car"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Due to inertia, your body continues moving at its initial velocity until an outside force (the seatbelt) acts on you to change your motion."
        },
        {
            question: "What was Newton's major achievement regarding the laws of motion? (Page 239)",
            options: [
                "He invented new experiments",

                "F = mv",
                "F = mg",
                "F = m/a"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Newton's second law states that net force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)."
        },
        {
            question: "If you double the force applied to an object while keeping its mass constant, what happens to its acceleration? (Page 246)",
            options: [
                "The acceleration doubles",
                "The acceleration stays the same",
                "The acceleration halves",
                "The acceleration becomes zero"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "According to F = ma, acceleration is directly proportional to force when mass is constant. If you double the force, the acceleration doubles."
        },
        {
            question: "If you kick a soccer ball that has twice the mass with the same force, what happens to its acceleration compared to the original ball? (Page 246)",
            options: [
                "The acceleration doubles",
                "The acceleration stays the same",
                "The acceleration becomes half",
                "The acceleration becomes zero"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Objects with more mass have more inertia. If mass doubles while force stays constant, acceleration becomes half according to F = ma."
        },
        {
            question: "According to Newton's Third Law, when a hammer strikes a nail, what is true about the forces? (Pages 252-253)",
            options: [
                "The hammer applies more force than the nail",
                "The nail applies more force than the hammer",
                "The forces are equal and opposite",
                "There is only one force involved"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Newton's third law states that for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. When a hammer strikes a nail, the nail exerts an equal force back on the hammer."

        {
            question: "Why does a person jumping on a trampoline bounce up? (Page 253)",
            options: [
                "Because gravity temporarily stops working",
                "Because the trampoline's reaction force pushes back with equal force",
                "Because trampolines naturally move upward",
                "Because air pressure pushes the person up"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "When someone jumps on a trampoline, they exert a downward force. According to Newton's third law, the trampoline exerts an equal and opposite reaction force upward, causing the person to bounce up."

            question: "If a 1,500 kg car needs to accelerate at 0.03 m/s² to the east, what net force must be applied? (Page 247)",
            options: [
                "45 N to the east",
                "45 N to the west",
                "50 N to the east",
                "50 N to the west"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Using F = ma: F = (1500 kg)(0.03 m/s²) = 45 N. Since acceleration is to the east, the force must also be to the east."

                "8 m/s² forward"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Using F = ma and solving for a: a = F/m = 4000 N/1000 kg = 4 m/s². Direction is the same as the force."

            question: "What are the four fundamental forces in physics? (Page 256)",
            options: [

        },
        {
            question: "Which of the following is true about the strong nuclear force? (Page 257)",
            options: [
                "It is the weakest of the fundamental forces",
                "It acts over very large distances",
                "It is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force",
                "It repels protons from each other"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "The strong nuclear force is the strongest of the four fundamental forces. Although it only acts over a very small distance, it is about 100 times stronger than the repulsive electromagnetic force."
