    <h1>Module 4: Chemical Bonding</h1>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>When you combine a good theory and good model you are able to explain lots of observations. Dalton's atomic theory states that all matter is made of atoms and that different substances are made from different combinations of atoms. Bohr's model of the atom, with electrons in energy levels, can be used to explain how elements combine to form compounds and even how some compounds will "stick" together.</p>

        <h3>Natural Notes</h3>
        <p>We saw in the last module how the ordered nature of God is revealed in the structure of the atom and the organization of the elements in the periodic table. Yet the study of chemistry can show us so much more about the Creator. Looking at how atoms bond with each other will give us a glimpse at the diversity of creation. Just imagine - everything you see around you is made up of atoms from just 90 elements. It is in the way these atoms give, take, or share their valence electrons in chemical bonds that new substances are formed.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>May you see how beautifully ordered and bountiful the diversity of creation is as you study this module.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>A MODEL FOR CHEMICAL CHANGES</h2>
        <p>In any chemical change, old combinations of elements break up and new combinations form. This means that the bonds that link two or more atoms together must break so that new bonds can form. How these bonds form or break depends on the valence electrons of the atoms in each molecule. Chemical properties, such as reactivity, depend on the electron configuration of the element.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Formulas</h3>
        <p>Have you ever made peanut butter cookies? There is a simple recipe using just 3 ingredients: 2 cups peanut butter, 1 cup sugar, and 2 eggs. This recipe makes about 48 cookies and the ratio of ingredients is 2:1:2. You can increase or decrease the number of cookies you make simply by increasing or decreasing the amount of the ingredients. But, to have your cookies taste the same, you must keep the ingredients in the same ratio.</p>
